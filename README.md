# Viterbi-decoder
### This decoder uses the Viterbi algorithm for decoding a bitstream that has been encoded using a convolutional code or trellis code. It does the maximum likelihood decoding. This photo shows tha path that has the max cost, so we will get its sequence if the initial is state 11 as described in the testbench
